# Changelog

## 1.3.0 (tbd)

### Neural Amp Modeler (NAM)
* Reworked NAM processing to more closely match the reference implementation. Resampling performance fixes.
* Input leveling from model metadata is now applied for more consistent output levels across model (for first nam in chain)
* Unified and simplified auto-gain calibration.

### IR Cab
* Added **pan** or **L/R split** controls to the IR Cab, enabling true stereo cabinet placement.
* Simplified and corrected IR level normalization

### Signal Chain & Performance
* **Faster preset switching**: presets now load on a background thread, eliminating audio interruptions when changing presets.
* Signal chain is safely paused during preset loading to prevent partial-state processing artifacts.
* New **parallel execution pipeline** for the effects chain with adaptive workload balancing, improving CPU efficiency on multi-core systems.
* Mono/stereo mode is now correctly recalled between sessions.

### EQ
* Low and high shelf filters now expose a **Q / resonance** control for more precise tonal shaping.

### Mixer / Splitter
* Fixed delay option on the Mixer/Splitter node. iF your preset suddenly have a delay it's becuase it wasn't working before, check the mixer node.

### UI / UX
* Overhauled **Tone Sharing and Browser** experience.
* Preset folder rename and delete workflow improvements.
* **Toast notifications**: status messages now appear as floating overlays rather than being embedded in the footer bar.
* Improved inline knob editor keyboard input behavior.
* Light mode styling improvements.

### Plugin Host
* Prevented a crash that could occur when the plugin attempted to host itself.
* Improved LV2 plugin list handling and support for bundle-hierarchy plugin types.
* Plugin list UI updated with cleaner item selection and keyboard navigation support.
* When running inside a DAW as a plugin, input channel and mono/stereo mode are now correctly delegated to the host.

### Tone 3000 / Sharing
* Improved Tone3000 integration; the library tab (used for advanced/experimental blends) is now **disabled by default** in Settings to avoid confusion.
* Shared preset titles now prefer the original published name.
* Improved resource handling and UI for shared/imported presets.

### Fixes
* Fixed preset pack uninstall.
* Fixed resource naming during import/export publish.
* Preset-level data no longer inadvertently inherits global signal chain settings.
* DSP diagnostic message rate is now debounced to reduce UI thread overhead.

## 1.2.0 (June 05, 2026)
* Support for NAM A2 architecture, including option to adjust NAM processing quality (Settings > DSP Performance). 
* Updated Tone 3000 integration, default to A2 nam models
* Mono/Stereo path DSP optimizations
* Combined performance work drops single-thread/core DSP usage from 30% to 5-10% when using mono path with NAM A2 in "slim" (min) quality mode.
* Clap plugin available on all platforms

## 1.1.0 (May 23, 2026)
